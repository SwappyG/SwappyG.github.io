Not much to see here yet and hard to say what you can expect to see either. This was created with a few high level goals:
- Help me write more. Preferably on some regular cadence. I want to get into the habit of capturing my thoughts and this is an attempt to facilitate that. 
- Encourage me to dive deep into topics I'm interested in. If I'm going to publish something anyone can read, then I wouldn't be happy with myself if it didn't meet some minimum standards. 
- Incentivize smaller, more actionable targets. If I'm writing on a fast cadence while maintaining quality, then the scope of each post will be small.
- Act as a reference in the future when I'm discussing ideas covered in my posts with others. It'll be easier to communicate those ideas if they are readily accessible in a digestible format. 

To start, I will commit to at least one post per week, with the first few likely being very small in scope. After about 4-8 posts, I'll have a better feel for what I can do in a week as well as what kind of posts I enjoy making, and re-evaluate the cadence and focus. If you're reading this before anything exists, see you in a week!
